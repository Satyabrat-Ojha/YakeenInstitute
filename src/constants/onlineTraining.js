      "If a mobile app is built for Android and iOS without the Flutter framework, there will be the need for two different development teams. One for the Android app and another for the iOS app. But Flutter uses Dart programming and avoids the need for writing different code for Android and iOS.",
      "The demand for Flutter Developers is massive in India and globally. If you have Flutter development skills, you can become a highly-paid App Developer in India or in other countries. The average salary of a Flutter developer in India is INR 5.39 lakh.",
      "It is time for you to learn this highly-paid skill by enrolling in the Classroom-based Flutter course in Jodhpur. You will get complete Google Flutter training from industry experts having a decade of experience as a mobile app developer.",
